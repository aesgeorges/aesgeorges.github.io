OnÃ¨, RespÃ¨!

I am a Haitian ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡¹ engineer and researcher working on the role of mangroves as natural infrastructure for coastal adaptation and resilience in the Caribbean Islands.

I am interested in the use of remote sensing and hydrodynamic/geomorphodynamic modeling to track the evolution of mangrove forests in Haiti and the Caribbean and study their potential as natural coastal protection infrastructure against sea-level rise and storm surges. I am also interested in using Data Science and Public Policy to better understand how different conservation policies across the region inform the resilience and vulnerability of these (natural eco-) systems.

I am currently working on the following projects as a PhD Candidate at UC Berkeley:

[Remote Sensing of Mangrove Forests in Haiti](https://github.com/aesgeorges/MangroveCaribRS)

[Hydrodynamic Modeling of Mangrove Forests in Haiti](https://github.com/aesgeorges/LaGonaveFM)
